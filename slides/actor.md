##  Actor

The actor model is the other modern model that I'd highly recommend. Similiar to CSP, it uses a message passing concept
to communicate between processes. Instead of naming the channel like in CSP, you send messages to named mailboxes or
named Actors. Scala and Erlang/Elixir are two of the most popular languages that heavily rely on the Actor model.
