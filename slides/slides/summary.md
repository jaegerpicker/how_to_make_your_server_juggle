##  Summary

This was a just a tour of the 4 models of concurrency. Each one has numerous articles and books written
about them. I hope I sparked you to investigate the different models further and to truly see what modern programming has
to offer with concurrency. In general, I hope that more people explore modern concurrency models and build better systems for it.
