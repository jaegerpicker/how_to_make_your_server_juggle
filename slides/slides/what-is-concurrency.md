###  What is Concurrency?

Concurrency as defined by [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_%28computer_science%29)

> In computer science, concurrency is a property of systems in which several computations are executing simultaneously, and potentially interacting with each other. The computations may be executing on multiple cores in the same chip, preemptively time-shared threads on the same processor, or executed on physically separated processors.

In other words, allowing your application to handle many different concerns at once.
