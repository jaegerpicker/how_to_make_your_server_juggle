##  Actor

The actor model, is the other modern model that I'd highly recommend. Similiar to CSP it uses a message passing concept
to communicate between processes but it instead of naming the channel like in CSP, you send messages to named mailboxes or
named Actor's. Scala and Erlang/Elixir are two of the most popular languages that heavily relie on the Actor model.
